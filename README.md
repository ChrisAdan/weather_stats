# Analyzing Sample Weather Statistics

This repo organizes code for a classic data transformation and analytics task.

Given an input containing a large number (~50k) CSV files, the objective is to ingest, validate, standardize, and draw insights around temperature and other meteorological recordings from ~12K weather stations.

The README will be updated in stages as the project is progressed.

Thanks for reading!
